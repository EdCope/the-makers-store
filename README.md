# The Makers Store

The makers store is a lightweight API designed to represent an e-commerce website's API.

In this excercise, you'll be building out the features of this API. We won't be using any frameworks or any real databases, this excercise will focus solely on the architecture and some problems where functional programming might come in handy.

We want to stick to the premises that the core functionalities of our app should be functional, and we only want to use object oriented styles where I/O is concerned.

You can assume that all User I/O with this "API" will be done so through the command line rather than HTTP. As for the database I/O, we'll connect to a mysterious local database that should be explained in the boiler plate code provided.
